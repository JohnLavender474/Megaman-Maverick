# MEGAMAN MAVERICK

---

**Megaman Maverick** is a fan game based on the [classic Megaman series by Capcom](https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_Man_(original_series)).
All rights to the "Megaman" franchise are owned by Capcom. This game is developed solely for non-commercial purposes, 
in line with Capcom's lenient approach towards fan projects that do not seek to profit.

The game is currently under active development and is in a **pre-alpha** stage.

The game uses assets from the official Capcom games as well as from the community. See the [Credits](#Credits) section
below for attributions to the creators. Special thanks to these creators for helping to make my dream of creating
a Megaman game become a reality!

The game is built using the [Mega 2D Game Engine](https://github.com/JohnLavender474/Mega-2D-Game-Engine), an engine
built on top of the popular open-source [LibGDX game library](https://libgdx.com/). This game is programmed primarily in
Kotlin, with few parts written in Java.

## THE STORY

Written by _oldlavygenes_ (me) and _PJCosta5_

### Opening Text

    In the year 20XX…

    Three years after the Roboenza Incident, 
    the world still bears lasting scars.
    
    To prevent another robot uprising, the human government 
    imposes new laws: robots are to bemonitored, 
    their every thought and action under surveillance.
    
    This fragile peace comes at a steep price. 
    With robots restricted, their costs have soared.
    Only the wealthy can afford them, while others 
    must compete against the robots for meager wages.
    
    Divisions grow deeper. Some humans champion coexistence 
    while others demand the destruction of the robots.
    Even Mega Man, once a beacon of hope, faces harsh scrutiny — 
    once hailed as a hero, now the humans distrust him too.
    
    Suddenly, chaos ensues to Mega City. A rogue faction of robots,
    calling themselves The Mavericks and led by the enigmatic Schisma,
    has risen to challenge humanity's laws and seize control.
    
    Mega Man must rise to protect the world against certain doom,
    as uncertainty and evil fester in the shadows...

### Intro Stage: Mega City's Ruins

Objective: Save civilians, stop the Maverick attack, and gather intelligence on their leader.

Mega City is under siege. Robots rampage through the streets, structures burn, and humans flee in
terror. Mega Man arrives, pushing through waves of rogue machines. Along the way, he helps the
police rescue trapped civilians, avoids collapsing buildings, and neutralizes rogue robots.
At the stage's climax, Mega Man confronts the Maverick leader: Schisma, a menacing robot who
mocks humanity's weakness.

Schisma reveals to Megaman that he has incubated a variant strain of the Roboenza virus. 
This strain does not control the minds of the robots, but rather it magnifies feelings of 
desperation and revolt in the minds of the robots. In other words, the robots are “radicalized” 
rather than “controlled” by the the new virus.

Mega Man's weapons barely scratch him as he flies around Megaman in an impenetrable purple cloud 
of Roboenza. Before he can finish Mega Man off, however, Proto Man quickly arrives, shielding his 
brother, but not without taking damage himself, and teleports them both to safety.

Schisma laughs and declares, "This world belongs to us now. Humanity's reign is over!" before 
vanishing into the chaos.

### Explanation of the Name `Schisma`

Schisma’s name is a play on meanings.

The word schism is defined as “a split or division between strongly opposed sections or parties,
caused by differences in opinion or belief”. The word schismatic is a synonym of the word
maverick.

Meanwhile, the word schisma (not to be confused with schism) is a term in music theory which is
defined as “the interval between an acoustical pure and an equally tempered fifth”.

Although the meaning of schisma isn’t directly relevant to his character, the reasons for the choice
of this name is twofold: (1) the name is invocative of schism which is in fact directly relevant to the
character’s personality and (2) the name continues the long-held tradition of Megaman characters’
names being tied to musical terms, e.g. Rock, Roll, Bass, etc.

### Dr. Light’s Lab Cutscene

Dr. Light restores Mega Man. Proto Man meanwhile refuses help from Dr. Light, preferring to leave and
repair himself on his own. Before leaving, Proto Man reveals that Schisma is rallying robots who feel 
oppressed, radicalizing them and promising a society where robots will destroy the wealthy humans and
rule over the ones who remain. Worse yet, the Mavericks have seized and imprisoned Wily, forcing him 
against his will to build new Robot Masters to serve their cause!

Mega Man vows to stop the Mavericks, rescue Wily (despite their history), and prove that
coexistence between humans and robots is still possible.

### Dr. Light’s Training Room

Dr. Light equips Mega Man with a few new power-ups along with the protective immunization system 
(*from Super Adventure Rockman), an upgrade allowing him to neutralize infected robots without 
destroying them. The system also provides limited immunity to low-level infection and the ability 
to absorb purified virus clouds for temporary boosts.

With Dr. Light's medical upgrade, Megaman's gameplay has leveled up! Now, our heroic blue bomber...
• Can execute the new moves 'walljump' and ‘airdash’. These abilities persist limitless for the remaining duration of the game.
• Can withstand virus clouds up to a certain amount using the PIS. After being by three Roboenza clouds, Megaman will glow purple, lose the ability to use all weapons except the Mega Buster, lose the ability to charge his Mega Buster, and will take double damage.
• Can upgrade his internal abilities, but only if he buys them as Auto's Shop (examples: Virus/Roboenza Cloud Immunity LVL2, Charge Shot LVL3, Sliding Speed LVL2, etc).

Once Megaman finishes his training session, he thanks Dr. Light for the upgrades and
start his main mission once again. 

It's time to fight The Mavericks and save the world again!

### Core Gameplay and Story Progression

Mega Man must take down eight Maverick Robot Masters.

If Megaman defeats any Robot Master without using that Robot Master's weakness, then the Robot Master
is spared, and the Robot Master becomes un-radicalized, vowing to help Megaman. In this case, Megaman
will earn a trophy along with a minor upgrade provided by the Robot Master. (In a later version of the 
game, the Robot Master will be playable.) In this case, the first Robot Master that Megaman fights will
be "saved" (since Megaman will not have any special weapons by that point), and it is in this instance
that the mechanic will be revealed and explained to the player.

However, if Megaman uses the boss's special weapon, then the boss will explode and will have to be
re-beaten in the final stages of the game.

### Final Stages: Schisma’s Fortress

Mega Man infiltrates Schisma's fortress which is built in the middle of Mega City, battling 
advanced defenses. 

In one of the latter stages, Megaman confronts the eight Robot Masters. Each one lied to him about 
being remorseful and leaving the Mavericks. Not only that, but each one is stronger this time, 
with more health and dealing more damage to Megaman.

After defeating the eight Robot Masters, he discovers Wily, imprisoned and remorseful.

Wily admits, “For once, I didn’t want this! That... thing turned my genius against me!”

In the final showdown, Mega Man confronts Schisma. During the battle, Schisma reveals he was
Wily's prototype for a new age of robots—designed to question and rebel. He embodies the very
conflict between human control and robotic freedom.

Mega Man ultimately defeats Schisma but not before the fortress begins to collapse. A piece of
rubble falls onto Megaman, and he is pinned to the ground. Wily turns to Megaman and says,
"Haha! So I guess it IS by my own hand after all that you shall be destroyed! See you later,
Megaman... NOT!" Wily then runs away, leaving Megaman helpless among the explosions.

Suddenly, Proto Man appears and lifts the rubble off of Megaman and then teleports them both
out (again) before the building totally collapses.

They both teleport to a nearby cliff and watch as the fortress collapses and explodes.

### Ending Cutscene

Megaman's victory is bittersweet. While many rejoice in the defeat of Schisma, many robots
who had been silently in agreement with Schisma's motives begin to voice their opinions against
humanity's tyrannical new laws against them.

Seeing the divide grow ever wider between humans and robots, Megaman delivers a speech to the world.
"These events have shown us how far we've fallen. We cannot live in fear of each other. Robots and
humanity must live in peace. Each must learn to trust and strive to be trustworthy. If we do not act
as one, we will fall divided. Together, we can build a better future."

After the speech, Proto Man mockingly says, "Heh... You really think you can fix society with your
fluffy words and your Mega Buster? Evil will always perpetuate itself. It's a never-ending cycle.
Face it, Megaman. You're a cog in the grand machine of chaos and corruption."

Megaman, aghast at Proto Man's remarks, exclaims, "Maybe I can't solve all the world's issues, but
I have to try! This is what I was made for, to bring peace and goodness to this world. It might be
vain and hopeless, but I'll never stop trying!"

Megaman marches off while Proto Man continues to stand there, his head slightly lowered and his mind
lost in reflection.

## RUNNING THE GAME

Currently, there is no "official" release of this game since it is still under active development. However, see the
section below on how to run the game using the source code.

### BUILDING THE GAME FROM SOURCE

Since the game runs using gradle and JRE, you can build a JAR of the game yourself. Keep in mind that in order to run
the generated JAR, you will need Java 17+ installed on your local machine.

#### Pre-requisites:

- git
- Java 17+

1. Use `git` to clone the project to a suitable location on your desktop.
2. From the root directory, run one of the following:

- Run using gradle:
    - Run the following command to start the desktop application: `./gradlew lwjgl:run`.
    - Optionally, you can run the `build-run-desktop-alpha.sh` or `build-run-desktop-debug.sh` script instead. The former is
      a shortcut for the above command. Meanwhile, the latter script includes configurable args for debugging purposes.
    - See the [GDX Liftoff](#GDX-Liftoff) section for more gradle commands.

---

## PLAYING THE GAME

### CONTROLS

By default, the keyboard controls for the game are the following whether the 1st value is the keyboard key and the 2nd
value is the "in-game" action:
- A: LEFT
- D: RIGHT
- S: DOWN
- W: UP
- J: B
- K: A
- ENTER: START

These can be remapped through the Keyboard Settings screen. Use the keys for "UP" and "DOWN" (by default the "W" and "S"
keys respectively) to navigate to the game button you wish to remap and press the key for "START" (by default the "ENTER"
key). You will be prompted to press any key on the keyboard to assign that key's code to the in-game button action.

<img src="img/KeyboardSettings.png" width="600px"/>
<img src="img/PressToReassignKey.png" width="600px"/>

The game supports controllers and should detect a controller as soon as it is plugged in. The keyboard controls continue
to work even when a controller is connected. The game has been tested with the following controllers:
- PS3 controller
- Xbox 360 controller
- NES-style USB controller

When a controller is connected, default mappings are assigned. Most likely, you will want to configure these mappings.
In the "Controller Settings" screen, you can reassign the mappings for the controller similarly to how the same is done
for the keyboard mappings.

### STARTING THE GAME (ALPHA)

This section pertains to starting an alpha build of the game (which can be started via the `./build-run-desktop-alpha.sh`
script), and it will be updated when beta and release versions are eventually released. To run an

When launching an alpha build, the first screen you see should be something like the following.

<img src="img/StartAlphaGame.png" width="600px"/>

Press the key that corresponds to the command you wish to run. To quit the app, press the ESCAPE key.

If you press ENTER, you will be taken to the "Select Level" screen. Here, you can select any level you want to play.
Levels are separated into three categories:
- Beta: Levels that are over halfway complete but may require some level of redesigning
- Alpha: Levels that are less than halfway complete and require major redesigning
- Test: Levels that are made purely for testing game functionality, and that will not be included in release versions of the game

Navigate to the level you wish to play and press the key for START. This will launch the level. **NOTE: Due to the fact
that this game is an alpha, don't be surprised if the game crashes or if you encounter any bugs!**

To exit out of a level early, press the ESCAPE key. From the "Select Level" screen, you can return back to the start
screen by pressing the ESCAPE key.

## GDX Liftoff

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and an `ApplicationAdapter` extension that draws libGDX logo.

### Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.

### Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should 
be replaced with the ID of a specific project. For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` 
project.
