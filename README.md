# MEGAMAN MAVERICK

This game uses a mix of assets made my myself, Capcom, and fan artists. Currently, no credits have yet been given in 
the README or in-game. In the `assets` folder, you can find for some of the assets`.txt` files that contains links to 
the sources of assets. I will be adding comprehensive credits to the README and in-game credits soon.

## THE GAME

A simple fan game I'm working on in my spare time. Written in Kotlin using
my custom-made <a href="https://github.com/JohnLavender474/2D-Game-Engine">2D Game Engine</a> and built upon the
popular open-source game library <a href="https://libgdx.com/">LibGDX</a>.

This project was originally started in 2020 and written in Java. However, I was in school
at the time of committing to the project and have only worked on it in piecemeal since then.
Also, through the course of my studies and Summer 2023 internship experience, I became familiar
with Kotlin and good system design practices. Therefore, I started working on refactoring my code
to build the 2D Game Engine library which utilizes a lot of what I learned along the way and greatly
improves the code and design quality. After that, I commenced rewriting the game from Java into Kotlin
using the new library.

This game is in a very early stage and still has lots of more work to go before it is even in the alpha stage.
Nevertheless, I am very excited to continue working on it and see where it goes.
