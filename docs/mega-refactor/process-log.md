# Process log

Work that went into `master` for the mega refactor. Change this file only on `master`. Add one
entry for each merged or dropped branch, and for each docs-only change to the setup. Put the
newest entry at the bottom.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <branch or "master (docs)">

- Summary: what changed and why.
- Contract check: which checks in the branch `docs/CONTRACT.md` were done, and the result.
- Follow-up: items moved to `BACKLOG.md` or open issues.
```

## Entries

## 2026-10-22 — master (docs)

- Summary: set up the docs for the mega refactor in `docs/mega-refactor/`. Added the root
  `CLAUDE.md` with a pointer to this folder, and added `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore`.
- Contract check: not needed (docs only).
- Follow-up: fill in the levels and behaviors in `CONTRACT.md`. Pick the first branch from
  `BACKLOG.md`.

## 2026-10-22 — master (docs)

- Summary: removed the shared `CONTRACT.md`. Each branch now writes its own
  `docs/CONTRACT.md` during planning, before it changes code. Added `CONTRACT.md` to
  `branches/_template/docs/`.
- Contract check: not needed (docs only).
- Follow-up: pick the first branch from `BACKLOG.md`.
